# To Do List App

### Authors: Adarsh Suresh and Akshit Deshpande

This is a Kotlin-based project that emulates a regular To-Do List app. Each item will have a header and options to add a description, time and location. We use Firebase to store the To-Do list items and their details, so that users can login to the app on any device and view their To-Do list.
